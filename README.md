# Cozy-Skate-Game
Skate game made in Godot 4.2


BOXY SKATE DEMO
This is just a testing demo. Expect a lot of bugs.


CONTROLLER ONLY!!
Tricks controls displayed. 
Holding RB and LB you can do tricks variants.
LT and RT allows to do manuals.
To grind, you have to hold "Y" before colliding with the rail.
The GOAL is to try surpassing your highest score.
To do that, you can chain a line by doing manual anytime you're on the floor. Each time you do a trick, you need to press LT or RT again to keep the manual and hold the trick line.
Grinding multiplies the score!
